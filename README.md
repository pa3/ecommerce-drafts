# e-commerce drafts

A bunch of architectural drafts of a hypotetical e-commerce admin panel using different approaches and/or frameworks.

## Overview

After spending around five years building e-commerce application web frontends I felt I wanted to crystalize my learnings on how they should be built, before switching to new fields.

I plan to build half a dozen drafts using different frameworks both to demonstrate that essential architectural parts are framework agnostic and to ease proposed solution discussions (if I will ever have any) with people comfortable with different stacks.
